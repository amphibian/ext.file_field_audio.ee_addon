File Field Audio Preview dynamically adds a tiny audio player to MP3 audio files selected via [nGen File Field](http://ngenworks.com/software/ee/ngen-file-field/) fields in the control panel. This compliments the built-in image previews offered by the fieldtype.

To install, upload the included files to your **extensions** folder, **language** folder, and **lib** folders respectively. Activate the extension, and enter the URL to your **lib** folder in its settings.  That's it.

This extension utilizes the excellent [1 Bit audio player](1bit.markwheeler.net/) by Mark Wheeler.

File Field Audio Preview has been tested on ExpressionEngine 1.6.8 with nGen File Field 0.9.10. IE 6 compatibility might be a little iffy.
